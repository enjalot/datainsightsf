    This is an Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS).

    It describes data on Infochimps.com and is meant to be both human
    and machine readable.

    An ICSS file is distributed with every download on Infochimps and
    is also available by request to the above URL.
    
    ICSS files bundled with downloads are generated at the time the
    download was created so they can become out of date as changes are
    made to the data.  If this ICSS came with data you downloaded then
    it is possible that it is already out of date.  You can get the
    most recent version at the URL above.

    The Statistical Abstract files are distributed by the "US Census Department":http://www.census.gov/population/www/popdata.html as Microsoft Excel files. These files have data mixed with notes and references, multiple tables per sheet, and, worst of all, the table headers are not easily matched to their rows and columns.
    
    A few files had extraneous characters in the title. These were corrected to be consistent. A few files have a sheet of crufty gibberish in the first slot. The sheet order was shuffled but no data were changed.
    
    The tables that were changed (this is table 335):
    
    <pre>
    0166 0257 0362 0429 0445 0446 0459 0461 0462 0464 0465 0466 0467
    0469 0479 0480 0481 0482 0483 0484 0485 0486 0487 0559 0628 0629

    </pre>
    
    This dataset consists of a table of 34 rows and 15 columns.
    
    
    Based on reports alleging child abuse and neglect that were referred for investigation by the respective child protective services agency in each state. The reporting period may be either calendar or fiscal year. The majority of States provided duplicated counts. Also, varying number of states reported the various characteristics presented below. A substantiated case represents a type of investigation disposition that determines that there is sufficient evidence under state law to conclude that maltreatment occurred or that the child is at risk of maltreatment. An indicated case represents a type of disposition that concludes that there was a reason to suspect maltreatment had occurred
    
    h3. Footnotes
    # Not all types of maltreatment are shown.
    # A child may be a victim of more than one maltreatment.
    Therefore, the total for this item adds up to more than 100 percent.
    # The increase in unknown age, sex, and race in 2005 is due to some
    states reporting summary data without breakdown of corresonding fields.
